### Here we convert the table in the supp of a paper to csv 
### Draft code written by ChatGPT 4.0 which I then tested and tweaked
### I copied and pasted the table into excel which resulted in no seperation by columns just blank spaces in between

###Â I used this for the dataset from the supplementary materials of this paper 
https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/suppl/10.1098/rspb.2016.0561

# Load necessary packages
library(tidyverse)

# Read the dataset
raw_dataset <- read.csv("~/Downloads/dataset_for_r_splitting.csv", header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Separate into columns at each blank space
cleaned_dataset <- raw_dataset %>%
  separate(V1, into = paste0("col", 1:10), sep = "\\s+", fill = "right", extra = "merge") 

# View result
print(cleaned_dataset) # note may be mistakes in some columns - check and edit manually in excel
